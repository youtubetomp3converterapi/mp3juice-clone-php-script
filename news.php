For more information check the <a href="special-rightholders-accounts/">takedown form</a>. </p> </div> <div class="text"> <h2>Update</h2> <p class="date"> August 24, 2017 </p> <p> We have made several updates these last days. If you get a 404 error just delete your browser cache, restart your browser and refresh the page and retry your request. If it is still not working use our <a href="contact/">contact form</a> to report the error. </p> </div> <div class="text"> <h2>nhaccuatui removed / faq page added</h2> <p class="date"> December 1, 2016 </p> <p> Today we've made some changes on Download-lagu-mp3.com. We've removed nhaccuatui as a download source - because it's working just too slow (it takes almost 1 min to load the page). <br> The other change is that we've added a <a href="faq/">faq</a> page (frequently asked questions) - here you can find answer to most of the questions we get. Please be sure to check the faq page before you send us any questions on our <a href="contact/">contact form</a>. </p> </div> <div class="text"> <h2>Download sources removed/added</h2> <p class="date"> October 20, 2016 </p> <p> We have removed the download sources Goear, YourListen and 3dl for the following reasons: </p> <p> - <strong>Goear</strong> stopped offering free music. Now it is only possible to get music with a registered and payed subscription. It is not possible to get any free files. So we have removed it. </p> <p> - <strong>YourListen</strong> the quality of the files has dropped. They have not added any new tracks either, so we have removed it. </p> <p> - <strong>3dl</strong> got shut down. Reason unknown. </p> <p> <span class="lt">- <strong>Nhaccuatui</strong> is as new download source. They deliver high quality files, you just need to be a bit patient when using this download source, because their loadings are really slow.</span> (update: Dec 1, 2016) </p> </div> <div class="text"> <h2>Bug fixes of download sources</h2> <p class="date"> June 2, 2016 </p> <p> We've fixed the broken download sources - Yandex and 4shared. Songs from 4shared can be downloaded now straight away without being redirected to 4shared.com. </p> </div> <div class="text"> <h2>Cloud Update</h2> <p class="date"> February 23, 2016 </p> <p> Today we have updated our site: from now on you are able to select a cloud provider where you can save your mp3 so you don't need to download it to your device. </p> <p> You may find the cloud menu above the results (see image 1). </p> <img src="<?= $c['cdns'];?>/images/cloud-provider.png" alt="Download-lagu-mp3.com"> <p> After you select a cloud provider a &bdquo;save to cloud&rdquo; button will appear on each download (see image 2). </p> <img src="<?= $c['cdns'];?>/images/cloud-button.png" alt="Download-lagu-mp3.com"> <p> Should you have any ideas for more cloud providers do not hesitate to contact us via our <a href="contact/">contact form</a>. </p> </div> <div class="text"> <h2>Mp3 cutter</h2> <p class="date"> July 12, 2015 </p> <p> Our Mp3 cutter is online since yesterday.
